<p>
The toolbar originally is located right underneath the menu bar, but it floatable
and can be dragged with the move by gripping the "knob" to the left of the bar.
The bar can be shown as a window on its own or as a docked part of the main
window, on the top, left, right or bottom (top is recommended).

<p>
To each button an action during a game is assigned. If an action is not available <br>
at a time, the corresponding button will be disabled and cannot be pressed.
</p>

<p>The buttons have got the following actions assigned:</p>
