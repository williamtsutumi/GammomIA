It doesnot take long to learn to play, although obscure situations do arisewhich require careful interpretation of the rules. The playing time foreach individual game is short, so it is often played in matches, forexample the first to five points. <i>Game</i> and <i>match</i> areused in Backgammon to refer to these distinct elements, as in, "I wontwo games in a row, but then she won three in a row and I lost thematch, three points to two."</p><p>In short, players are trying to get all of their pieces past theiropponent's pieces. This is difficult because the pieces are scatteredat first, and may be blocked or captured by the opponent's pieces.</p><p>Each side of the board has a track of twelve adjacent spaces, called <i>points</i>and usually represented by long triangles of alternating (butmeaningless) color. The tracks are imagined to be connected across thebreak in the middle and on just one edge of the board, making acontinuous line (but not a circle) of twenty-four points. The pointsare numbered from 1 to 24, with checkers always moving fromhigher-numbered points to lower-numbered points. The two players movetheir checkers in opposite directions, so the 1-point for one player isthe 24-point for the other. Some recorded games, however, keep thenumbering of the points constant from the perspective of one player.</p><p>Each player begins with two checkers on his 24-point, three checkerson his 8-point, and five checkers each on his 13-point and his 6-point.</p><p>Note that the board as shown can be flipped horizontally, withstarting positions and direction of play likewise flipped but with nochanges to the mechanics of gameplay. The two orientations are equallycommon and game boards are all designed to be played both ways.</p><p>Points one to six, where the player wants to get his pieces to, are called the <i>home board</i> or <i>inner board</i>.A player may not bear off any checkers unless all of his checkers arein his home board. Points seven to twelve are called the <i>outer board</i>,points thirteen to eighteen are the opponent's outer board, and pointsnineteen to twenty-four are the opponent's home board. The 7-point isoften referred to as the <i>bar point</i> and the 13-point as the <i>mid point</i>.</p><p>At the start of the game, each player rolls one die. Whoever rollshigher starts his first turn using the numbers on the already-rolleddice. In case of a tie, the players roll again. The players alternateturns and roll two dice at the beginning of each turn after the first.</p><p>After rolling the dice a player must, if possible, move checkers thenumber of points showing on each die. For example, if he rolls a 6 anda 3, he must move one checker six points forward and another one threepoints forward. The dice may be played in either order. The samechecker may be moved twice as long as the two moves are distinct: sixand then three, or three and then six, but not nine all at once.</p><p>If a player has no legal moves after rolling the dice, because allof the points to which he might move are occupied by two or more enemycheckers, he forfeits his turn. However, a player must play both diceif it is possible. If he has a legal move for one die only, he mustmake that move and then forfeit the use of the other die. (If he has alegal move for either die, but not both, he must play the highernumber.)</p><p>If a player rolls two of the same number (<i>doubles</i>) he mustplay each die twice. For example, upon rolling a 5 and a 5, he mustplay four checkers forward five spaces each. As before, a checker maybe moved multiple times as long as the moves are distinct.</p><p>A checker may land on any point occupied by no checkers or byfriendly checkers. Also it may land on a point occupied by exactly oneenemy checker (a lone piece is called a <i>blot</i>). In the latter case the blot has been <i>hit</i>, and is temporarily placed in the middle of the board on the <i>bar</i>,i.e., the divider between the home boards and the outfields. A checkermay never land on a point occupied by two or more enemy checkers. Thusno point is ever occupied by checkers from both players at the sametime.</p><p>Checkers on the bar re-enter the game through the opponent's homefield. A roll of 1 allows the checker to enter on the 24-point, a rollof 2 on the 23-point, etc. A player with one or more checkers on thebar may not move any other checkers until all of the checkers on thebar have re-entered the opponent's home field.</p><p>When all of a player's checkers are in his home board, he may remove them from the board, or <i>bear them off</i>.A roll of 1&nbsp;may be used to bear off a checker from the 1-point, a2 from the 2-point, etc. A number may not be used to bear off checkersfrom a lower point unless there are no checkers on any higher points.For example, a 4&nbsp;may be used to bear off a checker from the3-point only if there are no checkers on the 4-, 5-, and 6-points.</p><p>A checker borne off from a lower point than indicated on the diestill counts as the full die. For instance, suppose a player has onlyone checker on his 2-point and two checkers on his 1-point. Then onrolling 1-2, he may move the checker from the 2-point to the 1-point(using the 1 rolled), and then bear off from the 1-point (using the 2rolled). He is not required to maximize the use of his rolled 2 bybearing off from the 2-point.</p><p>If one player has not borne off any checkers by the time his opponent has borne off all fifteen, he has lost a <i>gammon</i>,which counts for twice a normal loss. If a player has not borne off anycheckers, and still has checkers on the bar, or in his opponent's homeboard by the time his opponent has borne off all fifteen, or both, hehas lost a <i>backgammon</i>, which counts for triple a normal loss.Sometimes a distinction is made between pieces in the opponent's homeboard (triple loss) and pieces on the bar (quadruple loss).</p><div class="editsection" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;">[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Backgammon&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: The doubling cube">edit</a>]</div><p><a name="The_doubling_cube" id="The_doubling_cube"></a></p><h3>The doubling cube</h3><p>To speed up match play and to increase the intensity of play and the need for strategy, a <i>doubling cube</i>is usually used. A doubling cube is a 6 sided die that instead of thenumbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 on it, has the numbers 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 onit. If a player believes his position to be superior he may, beforerolling the dice on his turn, <i>double</i>, i.e., demand that thegame be played for twice the current stakes. The doubling cube isplaced with the 2 side face up to show that the game's value has beendoubled. His opponent must either accept the challenge or resign thegame on the spot. Thereafter the right to <i>redouble</i> (doubleagain) belongs exclusively to the player who last accepted a double. Ifthis occurs, the cube is placed with the face of the next power of 2showing.</p><p>The game rarely is redoubled beyond 4 times the original stake, butthere is no theoretical limit on the number of doubles. Even though 64is the highest number on the doubling cube, the stakes may rise to 128,256, 512 and so on.</p></body></html>
