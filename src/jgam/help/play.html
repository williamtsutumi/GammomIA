<h1>JGammon - Introduction</h1>

<h2>Playing the first game with JGammon</h2>

<p>Once you have launched the JGammon program, the main window appears.
Please see the explication of <a href="page:mainwindow.html">the main window</a>
and <a href="page:toolbar.html">the toolbar</a> for further info.</p>

<h3>Start a local game</h3>
<p>In order to start the game press the start button which is the
left-most button in the toolbar.</p>

<p>In the upcoming dialog simply press OK. This dialog is discussed
<a href="page:newGameDialog.html">later</a> in detail.</p>

<h3>The initial board appears</h3>
<p>The game has begun: The initial backgammon setup is set onto the board
and the dices have been thrown to determine the starting player.</p>
<p>The player whose dice (colour!) has the higher number begins. You can always
see whose turn it is in the toolbar.</p>
<p>Point the mouse cursor to the checker that you want to move, press the
left mouse button and keep it pressed. Now you can drag around the checker.
Drop it onto the point onto which you want to drop it.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can doubleclick on a checker than it will make the largest
single step which is possible for it.</p>
<p>After you have made your moves according to the <a href="page:rules.html">rules</a>,
it's the other party's turn.</p>

<h3>Throwing the dice</h3>
<p>After the first moves are done it is up to the next player to decide
whether to double the game value or to throw the dice.</p>

<p>According to the rules, a player may only double if he/she was not the last
to double or if nobody has doubled yet.</p>

<p>As it is very unusual to double already after the first move, we choose to
throw the dice. Click the "THROW" button which is on the right of the
toolbar.</p>

<p>The dice are thrown and the player can now make his/her moves.</p>

<h3>Doubling the game value</h3>
<p>Assume that after some more moves the position seems good for party so that
he/she wants to double the game value. Instead of throwing the dice, press the
doubling button ("2x") in the toolbar.</p>

<p>The other party has to accept the doubling offer or turn it down. A dialog
pops up and asks whether the doubling is accepted (taken) or turned down (dropped).</p>

<h3>Giving up</h3>
<p>After some more moves the situation gets worse: I reckon I won't win this game
at all. So I propose I give up to my opponent.</p>
<p>I may choose between normal, gammon and backgammon giveup. The opponent will
be asked to accept/defeat the offer.</p>
<p>I can give up at any moment during the game, it doesn't have to be my
turn to do so.</p>

<h3>End of the game</h3>
<p>Every games comes to an end eventually. If one of the players has moved the
last checker to the off, the game is over.</p>
