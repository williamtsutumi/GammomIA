<h2>Designs in JGammon</h2>
<p>JGammon now supports different designs for the board that is played on.</p>
<p>The default board is the red/white/brown-leather backgammon case that the
program starts off with. The backgound image for this design is 1024x768 pixel 
in dimension. If this does not fit onto your screen, you can resize the board
by resizing the JGammon window. But note: Resizing decreases the quality of 
the bitmap. If you resize the bitmap images of the design have to scaled too, 
so it might take some time till they are loaded.</p>
<p>Apart from the brown leather design, the following designs are built in into JGammon:<p>
<ul>
<li>Blue/white/chrome. The graphics for this were initially taken from 
a screenshot of <a href="http://www.gnubg.org">Gnu Backgammon</a>.</li>
<li>Blue/red/sketch. A different one that looks a little like sketched on
a sketch block</li>
<li>Monochrome. This is a spatarnic design that can be resized arbitrarily. 
It is used in the history window and the load/save-dialog-previews.</li>
</ul>
